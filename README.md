# Circuit-Tracks-Sysex-Editor
A barebones editor for Novation Circuit Tracks sysex files, specifically to add a few features lacking in Novation Components like swapping knob assignments. Meant to be used in tandem with Components, not to replace it. NOT IN A WORKING STATE YET. 

### Dependencies 
* PyQt6, `pip install PyQt6`
